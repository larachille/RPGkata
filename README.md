### Follow the rules, use TDD
* You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
* You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
* You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.
* You should follow the circle Red - Green - Refactoring:
  * Red - Create a failing test
  * Green - Write enough code to make the test pass
  * Refactor - Clean up your code and your tests (don't forget that your tests are code too)
